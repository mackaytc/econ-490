## The Central Question

**Why are some cities so expensive while others aren't?**

- Glaeser and Gyourko's answer = **regulation-constrained supply**.

Paper provides:
- A way to measure how housing markets are performing
- An analysis of the consequences of housing markets failing to perform well

## Tobin's $q$ for Housing

Intuitively, measure value of assets relative to replacement cost:

$$\text{P/MPPC} = \frac{\text{Housing Price}}{\text{Minimum Profitable Production Cost}}$$

- **MPPC** = what it actually costs to build a house (land, materials, labor, etc.)
- **P/MPPC > 1** suggests something is preventing new construction

If prices exceed costs but builders aren't building, something's wrong

</div>

<div class="slide">

## What Goes Into MPPC?

**Physical construction costs:**
- RS Means data: roughly $70–$90/sq ft depending on market (economy-quality homes)
- Varies some by region, but not dramatically

**Land costs:**
- Vacant land sales rarely observed; imputed as 20% of (land + construction) via builder surveys

**Normal profit margin:**
- Builders need ~17% markup to stay in business

</div>

## A Useful Benchmark

In a **competitive, unregulated market**, we'd expect:

$$\text{P/MPPC} \approx 1$$

Prices should hover around the cost of building new units

- If they exceed that, builders enter, supply increases, prices fall back
- If P/MPPC stays well above 1 for years, supply is constrained

</div>

<div class="slide">

## What Do the Data Show?

National data from 2013 show ~74% of U.S. homes are priced at or below MPPC
- These are "cheap" markets where building isn't constrained
- Some markets, however, have higher P/MPPC ratios

| Metro Area | P/MPPC Ratio |
|------------|--------------|
| San Francisco–Oakland–Hayward | 2.84 |
| LA–Long Beach–Anaheim | > 2 |
| Oxnard–Thousand Oaks–Ventura | > 2 |

## 3 Types of Housing Markets

Glaeser and Gyourko define 3 types of housing markets
- We can map this classification to ranges of P/MPPC values

| Market Type | Example | P/MPPC | What's Happening |
|-------------|---------|--------|------------------|
| Declining | Detroit | < 1 | Prices below construction cost |
| Elastic | Atlanta | ≈ 1 | Supply responds to demand |
| Inelastic | San Francisco | >> 1 | Regulation blocks supply |

</div>

## California as a Special Case

Coastal metros — especially California — dominate the high P/MPPC list

What constrains supply?
- **Zoning**: Density limits, single-family requirements
- **Local Permitting**: Slow, expensive, uncertain
- **Community opposition**: NIMBYism

The authors call the gap between price and MPPC the **regulatory tax**

</div>

## The Regulatory Tax

The regulatory tax is the implicit cost of all the barriers to building

*How big is it?* For the median SF home (2013):
- MPPC = $281,690 (construction + imputed land + 17% profit margin)
- Market price = $800,000
- The "regulatory tax" ≈ $518K

</div>

## A Caveat

The authors note that the optimal tax on housing construction is **positive**
- Don't we want more housing?!
- In Orange County, yes, we should be building more

In general, however, construction imposes negative externalities
- Traffic disruption, noise, etc. during building
- Changes to built environment and service demand in longer run
- In principle, tax on building gets producers to internalize these costs

Paper argues that implicit regulatory tax is much larger than likely value of these negative externalities

## Who Wins and Who Loses?

**Winners:**
- Existing homeowners (their assets appreciate)
- Current residents who value "neighborhood character"

**Losers:**
- Renters (pay higher rents) and would-be buyers (priced out)
- Workers who'd move to productive areas but can't afford to

This has **distributional consequences**
- Housing wealth becomes concentrated among those who already own

</div>

## Labor Misallocation

High housing costs hurt the whole economy, not just individuals
- Productive cities (NYC, LA) have high wages *because* workers are productive there
- But workers can't afford to move there
- So they stay in less productive places
- Overall economic output is lower than it could be

</div>

<div class="slide">

## How Big Is This Cost?

The paper cites research estimating GDP losses from housing constraints:

- **Hsieh and Moretti (2017):** 9% of GDP lost due to spatial misallocation
- That's potentially **trillions of dollars** in foregone output

Glaeser and Gyourko report a range of estimated losses
- Reflects different assumptions about labor demand elasticity, but even the low end is very large
- Housing regulation in a handful of cities may cost the entire country several percentage points of GDP

## A Thought Experiment

Imagine housing costs in coastal California fell to national averages

What would happen?
- More workers could afford to live near high-productivity jobs
- Less time wasted commuting from the Inland Empire
- More startups could afford to locate here
- More service workers could live near their jobs

</div>

## Barriers to Construction

If restricted supply is so costly, why not just allow more building?

**Political Economy Problem:**

- Existing homeowners have **concentrated benefits** from high prices
- Costs are **diffuse** = spread across renters, potential movers, the broader economy
- Homeowners vote; future residents don't
- Local governments have strong incentives to restrict supply

</div>

<div class="slide">

## What Would Solutions Look Like?

1. **State-level override** of local zoning (e.g., California's SB 9, SB 35)
2. **Streamlined environmental review** for housing
3. **By-right development** that removes discretionary approval
4. **Incentives** for cities to allow more housing

## Key Takeaways

1. **P/MPPC ratios** measure whether prices exceed construction costs = a sign of supply constraints
    - Most U.S. housing is priced near construction cost; the expensive markets are outliers
    - **Coastal metros, especially California,** dominate the high P/MPPC list; regulation is the key factor

2. **Large economic costs** from supply restrictions (inequality, labor misallocation, lower GDP)

3. Authors argue **implicit tax exceeds reasonable externality costs**, but note the evidence is suggestive and the optimal tax on building is positive, not zero

4. **Political economy** makes reform difficult
