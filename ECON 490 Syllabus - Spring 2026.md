# ECON 490-01 Economics Capstone (Class Number 12775)

***Cal State Fullerton, Department of Economics***

## COURSE DESCRIPTION

From the CSU Fullerton course catalog: *"Taken in the last semester of studies. Students demonstrate proficiency in economic theory and quantitative methods and the ability to apply those to economic issues, including analyzing news reports, summarizing scholarly journal articles, writing policy and/or conducting original research."*

The overarching goal of this course is to develop your ability to consume and produce high-quality economics research. As part of this process, you will learn how to identify, evaluate, and synthesize existing theoretical and empirical economics research. You will also learn how to use economic theory and empirical economic analysis to assess economic claims and address research questions. Using the skills developed in this course, you will produce your own original economics research in the form of a final capstone paper.

If you have any questions about your eligibility to enroll in this course, please let me know before class or via email as soon as possible.

### Course Objectives and Learning Goals

The overarching goal of this course is to develop your ability to consume and produce high-quality economics research. The objectives for this course listed below are all designed to facilitate this goal and give you the skills required to produce your own original economics research in the form of the capstone paper.

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Search for, summarize, critically evaluate, and cite existing economic research and journal articles.
- Assess the merits of economic claims and arguments by:
  - Placing them in the context of existing theoretical and empirical economics literature,
  - Identifying the underlying assumptions made in those claims,
  - Evaluating the internal and external validity of those claims in the case of empirical arguments.
- Apply the analytical skills listed above to critically evaluate claims made in news and popular media as well as evaluating public policies.
- Create new economic knowledge in the form of your capstone paper and present this information in both a (1) written format and (2) an oral format via a professional, "economics-style" presentation to the class. In addition to the skills above, this objective also requires that you be able to:
  - Develop well-framed and coherent economics research questions and use economic theory and empirical economic data analysis to assess these questions.
  - Use the R statistical programming language to perform basic data cleaning tasks and conduct data analysis tasks including calculating summary statistics, performing regression analysis, and creating graphs and data visualizations.

### Required Texts and Materials

There is no official textbook for this course; all necessary readings will be posted on Canvas. I will, however, make regular reference to *The Effect* by Nick Huntington-Klein. This book is available freely online at the following URL: https://theeffectbook.net/. You can also purchase a physical copy of the book on Amazon.

As part of this course, we will make regular use of the R statistical programming language via RStudio. If you have your own laptop, you should plan to download a copy of both programs and bring your laptop to each class meeting. If you don't have a laptop, please note that having a computer is not a prerequisite for this course. The computers in the lab all have R installed and I will make sure you have the required resources to complete each activity in the lab or on the cloud from the library.

### Course Communication

All course announcements will be conducted via CSUF email accounts and Canvas. Therefore, you must check your CSUF email account on a regular basis (i.e., several times per week) for the duration of the course.

If you need to get in contact with me, please stop by my office hours or send me an email at [tmackay@fullerton.edu](mailto:tmackay@fullerton.edu). If you are unable to attend regularly scheduled office hours, I will be happy to schedule an appointment to meet either in-person or via Zoom at a suitable time.

### Response Time

During the week (Monday to Friday) I will try my best to reply to all emails within 24 hours. If you do not receive a response within a day, please don't hesitate to send a follow-up email or speak to me after class! I will reply to all emails sent over the weekend (Friday afternoon through Sunday) on the following Monday.

## Questions Regarding Late Assignments

In general, I am happy to answer any and all questions regarding class material, homework, and your capstone projects. However, this course is carefully structured to balance time allocated towards assignment grading and feedback in specific weeks in order to ensure that I have sufficient time each week to distribute between lecture preparation, instruction, and grading. 

Assignment deadlines have been specifically set in order to maximize my time availability for answering questions and providing feedback *prior* to those deadlines. As a result, I am *not* able to respond to lengthy or detailed questions regarding *late* submissions. While I will respond to simple "one-liner" requests, for example, confirming how to upload your submission, I do not have sufficient time available to respond to detailed questions, requests for draft or code review, or other time-intensive inquiries regarding submissions after their due date. After the deadline for any assignment in this course has passed, it is your responsibility to submit that assignment as soon as possible, using the course resources made available to you via Canvas, GitHub, and lecture.

## ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTIONS

### Capstone Project

- For the capstone project, you will demonstrate your ability to create new economic knowledge and convey this knowledge in both (1) written form via your capstone paper and (2) orally via a professional, "economics-style" presentation to the class. This project may be completed either individually or working with a partner.
- You will complete several intermediate assignments throughout the semester as part of completing your capstone paper, each of which will contribute to your final grade. These assignments are listed below along with respective due dates and their contributions to your final grade:
  - **Research Proposal** due Monday, 3/23 (2.5% of final grade): You will complete a worksheet summarizing your proposed capstone paper research question and data analysis plan. Proposals must receive my approval before proceeding to subsequent capstone assignments.
  - **Outline** due Monday, 4/13 (5% of final grade): Bullet-point-formatted outline of your Capstone paper, with descriptions of each component of the paper and preliminary results from your data analysis.
    - As part of the Outline assignment, you will deliver a 5-10 minute presentation in class during the week of April 13 in which you introduce your research question to the class, describe your working data set, and discuss at least one result from your data analysis output.
    - The presentation will count for 2.5% of your final grade.
  - **Final Presentations** during Weeks 14 and 15 (10% of final grade): 15-minute presentation delivered in class addressing your research question, motivation and existing evidence, analytical approach, and findings.
  - **Final Paper** due Friday, 5/15 (10% of final grade): 8-to-10-page essay written as an economics-style research article in which you identify a research question, cite, and synthesize existing economics literature, and conduct and interpret your own economic analysis.
- **NOTE:** You must receive my approval for your proposed research question identified in your Research Proposal in order to receive credit for any subsequent components of the capstone paper. Failure to do so will result in a 0 for all subsequent components and an automatic failing grade for the course.

### Homework

- We will have two broad types of homework assignments in this course: shorter-format R coding activities and longer-format homework assignments. Together, these assignments count for 30% of your final grade.
- We will complete 4 coding activities to give you the tools needed to complete the capstone paper. The coding activities together will count for 20% of your final grade, with each activity weighted equally.
  - I will introduce each activity during the class in which it is assigned and highlight any required packages, functions, and data you will need to complete the activity. You will then complete and submit your code for the activity prior to the start of next class.
  - These assignments will make use of R + RStudio. I've posted several options for you to get access to RStudio. You are not required to bring a laptop to lecture although you are encouraged to do so if possible.
  - Each activity will include instructions that clearly detail the requirements and expectations for that activity.
- Grading for the coding activities will be based on (1) completion and (2) accuracy.
  - With regards to accuracy, it is important that you use the specific tools described in each activity (meaning, for example, that you use `tidyverse` functions where specified instead of Base R functions or other alternatives).
  - A detailed rubric will be available on Canvas detailing expectations and grading for each activity. Solutions for each activity will be posted to Canvas following the posted due date.
- We will have 2-3 longer-format homework assignments throughout the semester where I will assign either 1) a reading and a corresponding set of short-answer questions or 2) a longer-format data analysis activity using R that is less structured than the R coding activities.
  - For reading-based assignments, you will be assigned a reading (e.g., a journal article, news article, or textbook chapter provided to you via Canvas) and write up paragraph-length responses to each question, then upload your responses in Word or PDF format to Canvas.
  - For R-based assignments, you will complete a longer-format data analysis activity that is less structured than the shorter R coding activities, requiring you to apply the skills developed in the coding activities to a more open-ended analysis task.
  - Each longer-format homework will be posted on Canvas at least two weeks prior to the due date for the assignment.
- The longer-format homework assignments will count towards 10% of your final grade, with each assignment weighted equally. If we have 2 longer-format homework assignments, each will be worth 5% of your final grade. A detailed rubric will be available on Canvas detailing grading for these assignments.

### In-Class Activities

- Each week, we will complete a graded, in-class activity that you will submit to demonstrate that you are following along with the course material and required reading. The in-class activities together are worth 40% of your final grade.
- Weekly activities will include either a 1) quiz or a 2) coding-based activity.
  - The quizzes will be roughly 1-2 pages long and will cover the assigned reading material for the current week and course content from the prior week. The quizzes will feature a mixture of short-answer, multiple choice, and definition-based questions. All quizzes will be completed individually, with no notes or other study materials available.
  - In-class coding activities will be self-contained R coding activities that you will complete and submit in class during the class in which they are assigned. You will be allowed to work with your classmates, but each student must submit their own code file.
  - A detailed answer key will be provided for each weekly activity quiz/R coding activity via Canvas. All submissions will be graded prior to the start of next week.
- In-class activities must be completed during the class in which they are assigned. There are no late submissions for in-class activities. At the end of the semester, I will drop the lowest in-class activity score for everyone, so students will effectively have one excused absence. Additional policies regarding attendance and excused absences are listed below.
  - For sections of ECON 490 that meet twice per week, the weekly activity may be assigned on either day during the week. Students who miss one of the two classes in a week but attend on the day of the activity will receive a 50 percent grade deduction for that week's activity. Students who miss the day of the activity will receive a 0 for that week, even if they attend the other day.
  - In addition to the dropped lowest score, absences covered by either of the two following circumstances will also be excused:
    1. A medical issue affecting either you or an immediate family member for which you have documentation (i.e., a doctor's note, etc.).
    2. A documented scheduling conflict for student athletes based on official documentation from Athletics Academic Services, in which one of the "Actual Missed Classes" listed in your "Missed Class Time Contract" specifically falls on a class meeting day.
  - In the event that you miss class due to one of the documented circumstances above, it is your responsibility to contact the professor and schedule a time to appear in person to complete the missed activity *prior* to the end of next week's lecture.
    - You will have up to one week through the end of the following week's lecture to schedule and complete the missed activity for full credit (i.e., if you miss lecture in Week 3, you can complete the activity at some point before the end of lecture in Week 4, including prior to Week 4's lecture or during break).
    - If you do not complete the missed activity within 1 week of the missed lecture, you will receive a 0 with no possibility of later make-up credit.
- ***Professional Conduct Policy:*** Students who are disruptive during class, disrespectful in their interactions with other students during class, or unprofessional in interactions with peers or the professor in any setting including class, office hours, and verbal or electronic communication including email, or otherwise impede the ability of others to learn, will face deductions to the In-Class Activities component of their final grade.
  - Behavior which meets any of the criteria listed above will receive formal notice from the professor via an email documenting the date and nature of the incident. The email subject line will read "ECON 490: Professional Conduct Notice" and will summarize the conduct policy, briefly state the reason for the notice, and state the associated grade penalty.
  - For the first violation, students will lose 5 percent of their overall possible In-Class Activities score. Subsequent violations will face escalating penalties in addition to prior penalties: for the 2nd violation, students will face a penalty of 20 percent, for a total deduction to their overall In-Class Activities score of 25 percent (5 percent for the first violation and 20 percent for the second). For the third violation, students will face an additional penalty of 25 percent, and in the event of a fourth violation, students will be penalized the remaining 50 percent of their overall In-Class Activities score.
  - As an example, a student who incurs 4 violations loses 100 percent of their possible In-Class Activities score, meaning that they can earn no more than 60 percent in the class overall (i.e., if they score 100 percent on all other grade categories and a 0 percent for the In-Class Activities category which counts for 40 percent of their final grade, they will earn a 60 percent in the class overall).
  - Behavior which is not appropriate for a professional, academic setting that does not rise to the level of violating the professional conduct policy, such as arriving to class more than 10 minutes late, leaving early without explanation, sleeping during class, etc., may result in receiving a 0 for that week's in-class activity (although this deduction will *not* count towards the cumulative penalties for larger infractions listed above).


### Late Assignments

All homework and capstone assignments submitted after their assigned due date will receive a 10-percentage point reduction for each day late. Late submissions will be accepted no later than 7 days after their initial due date, after which time no assignments will be accepted (and no subsequent make-up credit will be offered).

If you are scheduled to present during class and are unable to attend due to an emergency, please email me immediately to reschedule. Please include a copy of your slides or other presentation materials with your email prior to the class during which you're scheduled to present. As a general rule, I will plan to reschedule any missed presentations for the following class. Failure to provide presentation slides prior to your scheduled presentation date will result in a 20-percentage point reduction in your overall grade for the assignment. You are welcome to edit or update your slides prior to presenting in a subsequent class.

### Extra Credit Policy

I do not have extra credit assignments scheduled for this course. However, I reserve the right to apply a curve at the end of the semester in the event that the grade distribution for the class as a whole does not match the intended grade distribution. If the need for a curve arises, I will make an announcement in the final week of classes (Week 15). No other assignment-specific curves or extra credit will be considered.

### Assignment Grades and Final Grades Policies

You are welcome to meet with me during office hours to discuss your performance on any assignment throughout the semester. However, I am not able to conduct ad hoc adjustments to assignment grades. All such grades should be considered final. I am likewise not able to adjust final grades on an ad hoc basis (including requests for a "bump" in scores, etc.). I reserve the right to curve final grades, but in the event that a curve is applied, it will be applied uniformly across all students, and individual final grades will not be adjusted under any circumstances.

### Artificial Intelligence (AI) Policy

Some assignments in this course will directly ask students to use AI, in which case students should use AI under the guidelines provided with that assignment. However, for all other assignments, all writing for that assignment should be entirely in that student's own words. In particular, for all capstone assignments, including the proposal, outline, final presentation, and final paper, all writing everywhere in these assignments should be entirely in the student's own words. No writing anywhere in any of the four capstone assignments should be copied and pasted, or taken with only light edits (i.e., simply changing words or other engaging in minor edits, rephrasing, and restructuring) from AI/LLM sources including ChatGPT, Claude, and any other LLM-like resource.

In the event that the professor believes that a student has used AI to generate a capstone assignment either directly via copy-paste or with only light edits without providing attribution or citation, the professor reserves the right to convert that assignment to a written exam format. The professor may exercise this option if ANY of the following conditions holds: 1) there is substantial and reasonable suspicion based on stylistic inconsistencies within the submission itself, 2) inconsistencies with prior written work submitted by that student, or 3) there is wording similar to typical AI outputs including output generated by the professor (with the understanding that LLM output is probabilistic and thus the threshold for similarity is not exact duplication but is instead "substantial likeness" or "conceptual similarity" with respect to specific claims and arguments made, regardless of exact phrasing).

Students will be given a written exam based on their assignment submission, and they will be graded on the basis of this exam for the relevant capstone assignment. The student will be notified of this decision via email and will then have 7 days to take an in-person, short question and/or essay-based written exam covering the contents of that particular assignment. The exam questions will assess mastery of the written portion of the relevant capstone assignment, to confirm that the student has in fact written the material they have submitted. Students failing to take the exam within 7 days of being contacted by the professor will automatically receive a 0 for that capstone assignment. Students will not be provided with a list of questions beforehand; any written content included with the student's submission will be considered relevant for inclusion as a possible exam question. The written exam will strictly cover the same content topics as those submitted in the relevant capstone assignment and will not introduce new or unrelated material. Students will be provided with a copy of their data analysis output and works cited list. Students requiring accommodations under university policy or facing exceptional circumstances will receive consideration according to standard university guidelines. 

## OTHER GENERAL COURSE POLICIES

### Responsibility for Course Materials

Students are responsible for reviewing all course material, including lecture slides, handouts, Canvas announcements, and emails from the professor. Students are expected to carefully review all assignments and the requirements and guidelines for those assignments. Failing to attend class, or failing to pay attention during class, does not excuse students from this responsibility. Failing to be aware of course policies, assignment requirements, etc. is not an acceptable justification for failure to follow those policies.

All lecture material including slides, R coding material, reading activities, and other materials will be posted to Canvas and organized via "Weekly Overview" pages posted to the course Modules page. All assignments for this class will have a dedicated Canvas Assignments page. Students with documented accommodations or emergency situations should notify me as soon as possible in the event that there is a situation which prevents their access to relevant course material.

### Academic Dishonesty

Academic honesty is a requirement for passing this class. Any student who compromises the academic integrity of this course may be subject to a failing grade. You are welcome to work on in-class activities and homework assignments with other students, but submissions for these exercises must be written in your own words.

Academic dishonesty includes but is not limited to cheating on examinations or assignments, unauthorized collaboration, plagiarism, falsification/fabrication of university documents, any act designed to give unfair academic advantage to the student (such as, but not limited to, submission of essentially the same written assignment for two courses without the prior permission of the instructor), assisting or allowing any of these acts, or the attempt to commit such acts. Proper citation is necessary in all written assignments.

In the event of an instance of academic dishonesty, penalties may range from a failing grade on that assignment, to failure for the course, depending on the context and severity of the violation. All instances of academic misconduct will be reported to the Student Conduct office.

Finally, the instructor will not tolerate unethical and/or disrespectful behavior toward anyone. The classroom is and should remain a safe learning environment. Students who act unethically or disrespectfully will be asked to leave the classroom, and these students may be referred to administrators depending on the specific behavior.

### Changes to the Syllabus

I reserve the right to alter any information, assignments, grading criteria, deadlines, etc. provided in this syllabus at any time during the semester. Students will be notified of any changes via email and Canvas announcements.

### CBE Assessment Statement

The programs offered in College of Business and Economics (CBE) at Cal State Fullerton are designed to provide every student with the knowledge and skills essential for a successful career in business. Since assessment plays a vital role in CBE's drive to offer the best, several assessment tools are implemented to constantly evaluate our program as well as our students' progress. Students, faculty, and staff should expect to participate in CBE assessment activities. In doing so, CBE is able to measure its strengths and weaknesses, and continue to cultivate a climate of excellence in its students and programs.

Assurance of Learning (AoL) is an integral part of both our AACSB and WASC accreditation. For more information on our College-based assurance of learning efforts, please visit https://business.fullerton.edu/assessment.

### Students' Rights to Accommodations

The professor will accommodate arrangements made through the Disability Support Services (DSS). Students with documented special needs may qualify for specific arrangements related to attending class sessions, carrying out class assignments, and/or writing papers or examinations.  UPS 300.001 states that “it is the responsibility of students with disabilities to apply for services” via the DSS. “Students are not required to disclose their actual condition to anyone other than the DSS counselor.” When a DSS counselor has documented the condition and determined the appropriate accommodation, the DSS office will provide the faculty and student with a Letter of Accommodation (LOA).
