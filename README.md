# ECON 490 Course Material

This repository contains course materials for ECON 490 Economics Capstone at Cal State Fullerton (Spring 2026). Materials include lecture slides, R coding activities, and readings covering econometrics, data analysis, and applied economics topics including housing, transportation, minimum wages, and crime. You can find a link for the [syllabus here](https://github.com/mackaytc/econ-490/blob/main/ECON%20490%20Syllabus%20-%20Spring%202026.md).

Each week, I'll post links for lecture slides and R coding-related material below. Coding activities and other homework assignments should be submitted via Canvas.
